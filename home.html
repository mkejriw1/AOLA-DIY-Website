Aola Handmade cards is a celebration of our contemporary lives , a living 
culture and not part of a mass imposed, one size fits all, consumer 
culture where everything looks the same and is easily boxed up. Each handmade 
item is about people and not machines. It is about the time and effort that goes into each piece of work, it is about 
the skill of each maker, the technical ingenuity of the maker, the magic of an individual&rsquo;s 
imagination, and it is a treasure on a beach of throwaway machine made tat!<br class="clearright">
